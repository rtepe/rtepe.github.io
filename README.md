### Description

Stock Vision is a mobile application designed to provide users with a real-time stock/ETF
simulation using past stock/ETF data. It allows users to invest using our application’s fake
currency and get real-time results/tips about their investments. The application leverages
advanced machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to forecast the future
trends of various stocks and teaches users the fundamentals of stock/ETF predictions with
hands-on experience simulation.

The primary goal of the application is to offer users a reliable tool for predicting stock market
movements and providing tips and results by showing the analysis, especially for users who are
new to the stock market. The application's intuitive and user-friendly interface allows users to
invest in our fake currency, get real-time tips, and become familiar with the stock market.
Initially, the user will proceed with the registration process if they still need to, followed by
logging into the system. Upon successful login, users will gain access to real-time stock and
ETF values, which they can browse and search. Comprehensive graphical representations of
cryptocurrency performance in the stock market are available daily, weekly, monthly, and
annual. Users are encouraged to explore these cryptocurrencies, review the data provided, and
benefit from the insights offered by our AI algorithms.

Most importantly, each user will commence with a designated sum of fake currency, enabling
them to invest in stocks and ETFs. During the investment process, users can get tips from our
AI on investing their money, the chances of values going up or down, and see transactions and
real-time results of their gains or losses. With these insights, users can refine their proficiency in
interpreting graphical representations and witness the outcomes unfold in real time. If users run
out of fake money in the app, they can start over with the initial amount.
Additionally, Stock Vision has algorithms that analyze stock graph patterns and provide real-time
tips for the graphs. Analyzing stock values will be done with Machine Learning, and a wide
range of datasets of stock graph patterns will be used. Moreover, users' investments will be
stored in our database, and the user data will be analyzed. Some tips and results will be
provided after these analyses.

The application employs cutting-edge algorithms to capture complex patterns and correlations
within stock data. For different time range graphs, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or annually,
users capture different patterns. There are 9 fundamental patterns captured by our algorithms,
such as doubles, flag, head and shoulders, rectangle, rounding bottom, support and resistance,
triangle, triples, and wedge. After analyzing graphs and capturing complex patterns, a unique
machine-learning technique, ARIMA, is used to predict results and provide accurate and
up-to-date tips. After implementing LSTM, RNN, and Logistic Regression, ARIMA gave the most
accurate results and was used in the application. The accuracy of the predictions is further
enhanced through integration with a wide range of datasets, from a coin’s everyday results for
the last ten years, enabling the application to capture the predicted stock prices.
In conclusion, this mobile application offers an educational simulation for learning stock graphs
and gives insight into predicting the stock/ETFs. By implementing machine learning and
comprehensive data analysis, users can make informed decisions, optimize investment
strategies, and confidently navigate the complexities of the stock market using our application’s
fake currency and get real-time results/tips about their investments.
